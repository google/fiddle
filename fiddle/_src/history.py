"""History tracking for config objects.

In order to make it easier to understand how config objects have been
constructed, config objects keep track of the sequence of changes made to them.
This file contains the machinery to record this history and easily manipulate
it.

The history functionality has a few bits of non-trivial logic:

 1. Each history entry is associated with a monotonically increasing number.
    This allows sequencing history across multiple config objects. The
    implementation of this capability is guaranteed to be threadsafe, so users
    can mutate (different!) config objects from multiple threads without fear.
 2. The logic to determine where in the user's source code a mutation was
    generated is configurable. Simply use `custom_location` to temporarily set a
    different location provider; see the documentation on the `custom_location`
    context manager for an example.
