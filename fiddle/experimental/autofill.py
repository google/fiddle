"""Provides `autofill` to instantiate child configs for configurable arguments.

When configuring a type that depends on many other child types that are
themselves configurable, nested `fdl.Config` instances must be constructed for
each of them. This is can involve large amounts of mechanical boilerplate.

When a function or class has type annotations for its arguments, `autofill`
will recursively instantiate `fdl.Config`s for them.

`autofill` has the added benefit of further incentivizing type annotations, too!

By convention, `autofill` is often imported `as af` (which can also be
pronounced "auto-Fiddle").
