  """Uninterns tuples of literals in the given buildable.

  Tuples of literals are tuples containing immutable primitive values. Python
  normally interns (i.e. share the same instance) tuples of literals. Interned
  objects are those that were declared in separate code locations but share the
  same instance (due to Python's optimizations). This can create problems with
  the differ and visualizer. This function "uninterns" these tuples (i.e.
  creates separate instances for each tuple) to solve this issue.

  Args:
    buildable: Any Fiddle buildable.

  Returns:
    A new buildable with the tuples uninterned.
