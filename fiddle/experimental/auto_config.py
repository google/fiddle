"""Provides utilities for transforming builder functions into `fdl.Config`s.

This module defines the `auto_config` function (and associated helpers), which
can be used to convert an existing function that creates an object graph into a
function that creates a graph of `Config` and `Partial` objects. When the
resulting graph of `Config` and `Partial` objects is built via `fdl.build()`, it
will yield same object graph as the original function.
